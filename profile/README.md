# FireAid Benefit Concert Live Updates

Less than three weeks after a series of historic wildfires killed 29 people and destroyed more than 16,000 structures in the Los Angeles area, more than two dozen of music’s biggest names have gathered for the **FireAid** benefit concert: “an evening of music and solidarity,” as organizers describe it, meant to raise money to provide relief to affected Angelenos and to “prevent future fire disasters throughout Southern California.”
